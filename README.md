This is the repository for my FWE 458 final project. 
Data cleaning and pre-processing steps are available in data_cleaning.ipynb.
To extract the ACS data on your own, use acs_extraction.ipynb. Otherwise, the data is included in acs_data_cleaned.csv.
The analysis is available in analysis.ipynb. It uses a cleaned dataset (cleaned_data.csv) that was made in data_cleaning.ipynb.
The lake_link.csv file was too large to push to Github and is available in a public Google Drive. 
Here is the Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1prHRXqs3ZB-PaA6HauPZL89HoCDzkGYe/view?usp=drive_link
